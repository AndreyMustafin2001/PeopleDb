# Name Manager üìñ

Welcome to Name Manager, a robust Qt-based application developed in C++ that simplifies managing a list of names with interactive and visually appealing features. Designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and powered by SQLite, this tool is perfect for anyone looking to efficiently handle name data.

## Key Features üåü

- Interactive Adding: Add names to both the visual list and SQLite database with a simple click on the '+' button.
- Effortless Removal: Remove names from the list and the database by clicking the '-' button.
- Existence Verification: Check if a name exists in the database by hitting the 'exists' button, which opens a popup window with the result.
- Bulk Operations: Clear all names from the database with the 'remove_all' button and display all stored names using 'print_all'.
- Stylish Interface: Arial font size 11, gray background, snow white text views, and color-differentiated buttons make for an intuitive user experience.
